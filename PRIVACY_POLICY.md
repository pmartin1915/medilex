# Privacy Policy for Healthcare Vocab (Medilex)

**Last Updated**: January 19, 2025

## Overview

Healthcare Vocab ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled in our mobile application.

## TL;DR

**We collect ZERO personal data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Data Collection

Healthcare Vocab does NOT collect, transmit, store, or share ANY personal information, usage data, or analytics.

**What we DON'T collect:**
- ❌ No personal information (name, email, phone)
- ❌ No usage analytics or tracking
- ❌ No crash reports sent to servers
- ❌ No advertising identifiers
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No device information
- ❌ No third-party tracking cookies

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally on your device only** using AsyncStorage (React Native's local storage API). This includes:

1. **Medical Terms**: Vocabulary definitions and examples
2. **Study Progress**: Your answers, accuracy, and mastered terms
3. **Streak Data**: Your study streak calendar and history

**This data:**
- ✅ Never leaves your device
- ✅ Is not synchronized to any cloud service
- ✅ Cannot be accessed by us or anyone else
- ✅ Is deleted when you uninstall the app

## Third-Party Services

This app does NOT use any third-party services including:
- No analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- No crash reporting services (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)
- No advertising networks
- No social media integrations
- No backend servers or APIs

The only third-party code used is:
- **React Native** - Open-source mobile framework
- **Expo** - Open-source development platform
- **React Navigation** - Open-source navigation library

These libraries run entirely on your device and do not transmit data.

## Audio Pronunciation

The app uses your device's built-in text-to-speech engine (Expo Speech API) to pronounce medical terms. This:
- Runs entirely offline on your device
- Does not send audio or text to external servers
- Uses your device's native speech synthesizer (iOS VoiceOver / Android TTS)

## Permissions

This app requests **ZERO permissions**:
- ❌ No camera access
- ❌ No microphone access
- ❌ No location access
- ❌ No contacts access
- ❌ No storage access (beyond app's sandboxed storage)
- ❌ No network/internet access required

The app works 100% offline.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all your data at any time:

1. **Delete Progress Data**: Go to Settings → Debug → "Clear All Data"
2. **Delete Everything**: Uninstall the app from your device

Once deleted, data is **permanently removed** and cannot be recovered (because we never had access to it in the first place).

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13 (COPPA) or 16 (GDPR). Parents can feel confident that no personal information is collected, stored, or shared.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

If we update this policy, we will:
1. Update the "Last Updated" date above
2. Notify users through an in-app message
3. Publish the updated policy in the app and on our website

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device using iOS/Android's secure storage APIs:
- Data is protected by your device's security (passcode, biometrics, encryption)
- We have no servers that could be breached
- No data in transit means no man-in-the-middle attacks
- Your data is as secure as your device's operating system

## Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA Compliance)

Even though we collect no data, here are your rights:

- **Right to Access**: You can view all your data in the app (Progress screen)
- **Right to Deletion**: Clear all data in Settings → Debug
- **Right to Portability**: Not applicable (no cloud storage)
- **Right to Rectification**: Edit progress data anytime
- **Right to Object**: Not applicable (no data processing)

- ✅ **CCPA** (California)
- ✅ **COPPA** (Children's Privacy)
- ✅ **PIPEDA** (Canada)
- ✅ **APP** (Australia)

Because we collect no data, we are compliant with all major privacy regulations worldwide.
