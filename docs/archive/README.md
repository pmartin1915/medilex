# Archived Documentation

This folder contains outdated or redundant documentation from earlier development sessions.

## Why These Were Archived

These files were created during development but are now:
- **Obsolete** - Issues they addressed have been fixed
- **Redundant** - Content is covered in the main docs
- **Outdated** - No longer reflect the current state

## Current Documentation

Use these files in the root directory instead:

1. **START-HERE.md** - Main entry point, tells you exactly what to do
2. **HOW-TO-RUN-APP.md** - Complete guide with troubleshooting
3. **README.md** - Project overview and features
4. **CLAUDE-AUTONOMOUS-TESTING.md** - For Claude Code autonomous testing

## What's In This Archive

- **ANDROID_WORKFLOW.md** - Old workflow guide (replaced by HOW-TO-RUN-APP.md)
- **CHANGES_SUMMARY.md** - Old change log (use git history instead)
- **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Outdated status from earlier session
- **DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md** - Old debugging guide (merged into HOW-TO-RUN-APP.md)
- **FIX_TURBOMODULE_ERROR.md** - Specific fix guide (issue now resolved)

## Should I Delete These?

You can safely delete this entire `docs/archive` folder if you want. Everything you need is in the root directory documentation.

We kept them just in case you want to reference something from earlier sessions.
