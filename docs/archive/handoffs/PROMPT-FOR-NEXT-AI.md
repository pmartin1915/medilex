# Prompt for Next AI Session

Hi! Continuing work on Healthcare Vocabulary App (React Native + Expo).

PROJECT LOCATION: D:\Medilex\HealthcareVocabApp

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ React downgraded from 19 → 18.2.0 (completed)
✅ All TypeScript errors fixed (37 errors resolved)
✅ App compiles successfully
✅ New LAUNCH.bat master launcher created
✅ Documentation organized and indexed
✅ Old .bat files archived to _archive_bat\

WHAT JUST HAPPENED:
- Consolidated 36+ .bat files into one master LAUNCH.bat
- Created BAT_FILES_INVENTORY.md documenting all scripts
- Created DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md organizing all docs
- Archived 18 superseded .bat files to _archive_bat\
- Kept essential specialized scripts in root

NEW MASTER LAUNCHER (LAUNCH.bat):
Double-click LAUNCH.bat for everything:
  [1] Start App (Web)
  [2] Start App (iOS - QR Code)
  [3] Start App (Android Emulator)
  [4] Show Current Errors
  [5] Copy Error Report for AI ⭐ USE THIS!
  [6] Monitor Live Logs
  [7] Clear Cache & Restart
  [8] Fix Android Connection
  [9] Full Reset (Nuclear Option)

SIMPLE WORKFLOW:
1. Double-click LAUNCH.bat
2. Choose platform to start app
3. If errors occur → Option [5] to copy error report
4. Paste error report to AI for help

KEY FILES:
- LAUNCH.bat ⭐ - Your primary launcher
- DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md - Find any documentation
- BAT_FILES_INVENTORY.md - Script reference
- App.tsx - Added enableScreens() at top
- package.json - React 18.2.0, React Native 0.81.5

DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE:
- Core docs in HealthcareVocabApp\
- Design docs in Documentation\
- Old scripts in _archive_bat\
- See DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for complete map

MY ENVIRONMENT:
- Windows (PowerShell)
- Project: D:\Medilex\HealthcareVocabApp
- Testing: iOS (Expo Go), Android Emulator, Web

NEXT STEPS:
1. Use LAUNCH.bat for all operations
2. If errors occur, use option [5] to copy for AI
3. Continue with feature development
4. Keep PROMPT-FOR-NEXT-AI.md updated
