# Archived BAT Files

These scripts have been superseded by **LAUNCH.bat** (the master launcher).

## Why These Were Archived

All functionality from these scripts is now available in LAUNCH.bat with a simple menu interface.

## What's Here

### Startup Scripts
- GO.bat, start.bat, launch.bat, quick-start.bat
- start-android.bat, start-android-simple.bat
- start-mobile.bat, start-web.bat
- RESTART.bat, STOP.bat

**Replaced by:** LAUNCH.bat options [1], [2], [3], [7]

### Diagnostic Scripts
- check-app-status.bat
- show-errors.bat
- read-app-logs.bat
- monitor-app.bat
- debug-mode.bat

**Replaced by:** LAUNCH.bat options [4], [5], [6]

### Fix Scripts

- fix-adb-quick.bat
- fix-android-connection.bat
- fix-emulator-nuclear.bat
- fix-expo-go.bat

**Replaced by:** LAUNCH.bat options [7], [8], [9]

## Can I Delete These?

**Not yet.** Keep them for 1-2 weeks to ensure LAUNCH.bat covers all use cases.

If you need any specific functionality from these scripts, check:
1. LAUNCH.bat first
2. BAT_FILES_INVENTORY.md for alternatives
3. These archived files as reference
